Feel free to leave any comments or notes for us here (or inline with code, e.g., `###COMMENT: [your comments here]`).

* "`[E]` Code Review: `Docs Controller`"
  I have been involved in very few code reviews, despite years of doing
  jobs that genuinely necessitate code reviews for the best end-product. While I have
  participated in informal reviews of both my own code and that of my peers, it is often
  a loosly structured session.

  Also, the Docs controller is a utility class that requires very little logic or data
  movement. It relies on simple IO and the use of HAML's Markdown filter. Therefore I
  could find little to provide comment or review upon in the responsible files.

* "`[D]` Add ListWise Integration"
  I do not have a ListWise account and was running low on time given my responsibilities
  this week/weekend.

* "`[B]` Fix issue where edit view shows HTML as TEXT"
  I was unclear on this issue, and, low on time, deeped it lower priority than the other tasks
  in the list that were more straightforward. Were I to have completed this task it
  would involve a WYSIWIG editor gem/javascript or removing all HTML styling from the titles.
